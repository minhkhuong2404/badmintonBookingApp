### **Notes**  
* Choose user's Facebook Id and email to be unique  

Risk | Mitigate
---- | --------
clone Facebook account used to book the slot | require user to authenticate by OTP code through email or phone number that used only for 1 account  
If there's problem with the user's FB account | depend on how the users manage their FB account  
Facebook's password can be leaked out | use short-lived token

### **Notes**  
* Choose user's Facebook Id and email to be unique  

* risk: there is can be a clone Facebook account used to book the slot -> it's hard to manage and identify the user  
* mitigate: can require user to authenticate by OTP code through email or phone number that used only for 1 account  
  
* risk: If there's problem with the user's FB account -> the user cannot log in and booking the slot  
* mitigate: there no way to mitigate this, it's base on how the users manage their FB account :">
